# SQL-Example
This is an example of the basics of the SQL language, done through the mySQL server but utilizing PopSQL to better visualize creating tables, running queries, etc.  In this project, I create a database of movies and utilize SQL to create an overall schema, help organize the data in a unified manner, and run queries to give me specific pieces of information.
